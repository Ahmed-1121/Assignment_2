# My World

## Introduction

I made this webpage as a brief introduction to myself. I tried to be more inclusive in talking about myself. This can be easily seen on the site, where I showed my personal photo and some of my programming and computer skills, as well as some of the events that I participated in in the past years in different countries and I tried to choose the most distinguished of them, and then I presented my hobbies in an attractive way, and in conclusion, I showed the best ways to communicate with me in the form of a card a job.

## Approach

When designing the web page, my focus was on interactive, fun and attractive to the user at first sight, as I wanted to show him something different at first sight.


## Overview
Initially, when you open the site, the first thing you will see is the infinity sign that moves constantly and changes colors, as well as the clock, which moving all the time. It took a lot of time to design these details but I think it was well worth it.

Then I wanted to attract the userâ€™s attention, so I did not give him my name and profession directly, but rather I wanted to arouse his curiosity to interact with the site and place the mouse on my picture to know more about me. The circle of colors that revolve around the image immediately attracts attention.

Then I displayed my skills and their value with stars from the highest skill to the lowest skill, and when pressing or moving the arrow on one of the skills it becomes a little bigger and a blurry effect appears on the rest of the skills.

Then I showed some of the events in which I participated and put an attractive and elegantly coordinated picture on it. I did not put any details or words directly, but I wanted to arouse the user's curiosity, so I hid the details under the picture and the user had to click on it to discover more about the event.

Then I elegantly display my hobbies and try to use an attractive, fun design (because that's what hobbies are expected to be fun). The title and icon for each hobby explain themselves, and I added small details to the explanation.

Then I presented the ways to communicate with me in the form of an attractive business card. If the user clicks on it, it will grow a little and interact with him.

I would like to point out that the site is fully responsive to all sizes of smart devices.


## Things that can be improved

1- Increase the amount of content.
2- Make the content more interactive with the user than the current method. As the current form focuses more on aesthetics and glamor, rather than providing an added value to the user.
3- Enriching the content more, as the current form contains a lot of spaces. The reason is that programming took a long time at the expense of content.
